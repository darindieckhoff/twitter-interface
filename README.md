# twitter-interface

This project uses Twitterâ€™s REST API to access your Twitter profile information and render it to a user. The page automatically authenticates access to your Twitter profile. It should use this access to populate three columns on your page:

Your 5 most recent tweets.
Your 5 most recent friends.
Your 5 most recent private messages.

Expanded project: 
Added a section to the bottom of your page that allows a user to post a new tweet.
Added an error page to your application, so that if anything goes wrong with your routes, the user will see a friendly message rendered, instead of the default error code.
Included background image from Twitter as a background for the page header.
