# twitter-interface

This project uses Twitterâ€™s REST API to access your Twitter profile information and render it to a user. The page automatically authenticates access to your Twitter profile. It should use this access to populate three columns on your page:

Your 5 most recent tweets.
Your 5 most recent friends.
Your 5 most recent private messages.
